# Title: Security System
I build this security system in C programming.

# What does this do?
The following program demonstrates a simple security system that requires the user to enter a password before they can access a restricted area. This program makes use of basic input/output functions, control structures, and string handling functions available in the C programming language.

# Purpose:
When the program is executed, the user is prompted to enter a password. The password is then checked for length and compared to a predefined secret password. If the user enters a password that matches the secret password, the authenticated variable is set to 1, allowing them to access the restricted area. If the user enters an invalid password, they are denied access.

This is a very basic security system that could be extended in many ways. For example, the program could be modified to store the secret password in a secure database or file, rather than hardcoding it in the source code. It could also be extended to include more advanced security features, such as encryption or multi-factor authentication. However, this example program demonstrates the basic principles of building a security system using C programming.
